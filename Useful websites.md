## **Patents** 

Innovation is almost always based on previous efforts and attempts. As a mechanical engineer who is interested in design I found the following websites to be incredibly helpful.

### [Espacenet: European patent office ](https://worldwide.espacenet.com/patent/)

### [The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO)](https://www.uspto.gov/)

## **Materials Selection, Fabrication, and Properties** 

### [MatWeb](https://www.matweb.com/search/search.aspx)

MatWeb's searchable database of material properties includes data sheets of thermoplastic and thermoset polymers such as ABS, nylon, polycarbonate, polyester, polyethylene and polypropylene; metals such as aluminum, cobalt, copper, lead, magnesium, nickel, steel, superalloys, titanium and zinc alloys; ceramics; plus semiconductors, fibers, and other engineering materials.

<!-- ### [Strength of Materials](https://mechanicalc.com/reference/strength-of-materials)

Strength of materials, also know as mechanics of materials, is focused on analyzing stresses and deflections in materials under load. Knowledge of stresses and deflections allows for the safe design of structures that are capable of supporting their intended loads.

### [Mechanical Properties of Materials](https://mechanicalc.com/reference/mechanical-properties-of-materials)

The mechanical properties of a material affect how it behaves as it is loaded. The elastic modulus of the material affects how much it deflects under a load, and the strength of the material determines the stresses that it can withstand before it fails. The ductility of a material also plays a significant role in determining when a material will break as it is loaded beyond its elastic limit. Because every mechanical system is subjected to loads during operation, it is important to understand how the materials that make up those mechanical systems behave.

This page describes the mechanical properties of materials that are relevant to the design and analysis of mechanical systems.

### [Column Buckling](https://mechanicalc.com/reference/column-buckling)

Short compression members will fail once the stress exceeds the compressive yield strength of the material. However, long compression members will fail due to buckling before the yield strength of the member is reached. Buckling occurs suddenly, and is characterized by large deflections perpendicular to the axis of the column.

A simple way to demonstrate column buckling is to hold a ruler at either end and to push your hands toward one another. The ruler will buckle at the center. -->

### [The International Association for the Properties of Water and Steam](http://iapws.org/relguide/IAPWS-95.html)

This formulation is recommended for the calculation of thermodynamic properties of ordinary water in its fluid phases, including vapor-liquid equilibrium.
The formulation (commonly referred to as IAPWS-95) is for the Helmholtz energy as a function of temperature and density; appropriate combinations of derivatives can produce any thermodynamic property desired (pressure, sound speed, heat capacity, enthalpy, entropy, etc.).
The formulation is valid in the entire stable fluid region from the melting curve to 1273 K at pressures to 1000 MPa. It extrapolates in a physically reasonable way outside this region.

### [Control using Matlab and Simulink tutorial](https://ctms.engin.umich.edu/CTMS/index.php?aux=Home)

The first step in the control design process is to develop appropriate mathematical models of the system to be controlled. These models may be derived either from physical laws or experimental data. In this section, we introduce the state-space and transfer function representations of dynamic systems. We then review some basic approaches to modeling mechanical and electrical systems and show how to generate these models in MATLAB for further analysis.
